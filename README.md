# InkBound

> Eventâ€‘driven WinTab tablet *window mapper* for Windows, written in Rust.

InkBound dynamically remaps your Wacom tablet's active area to a single application window
â€” selected by process name, window class, or title substring â€” and follows it instantly as it
moves, resizes, gains focus, minimizes, or is destroyed. No busy loops, no timers: just WinEvent
hooks and WinTab context updates.

## TL;DR (Quick Start)

```powershell
# Clone and build (MSVC toolchain required)
git clone https://github.com/freddiehaddad/inkbound.git
cd inkbound
cargo build --release

# Run with GUI only (choose target later)
./target/release/inkbound.exe

# Or immediately map to Photoshop keeping aspect
./target/release/inkbound.exe --process photoshop.exe --preserve-aspect
```

## Why Another Mapper?

Typical workflows either:

* Map the tablet to the whole desktop (wasted precision for a single app),
* Constantly visit the Wacom control panel, or
* Use polling tools that miss fast resizes or add latency.

InkBound fuses lightweight OS notifications (WinEvent) with direct WinTab context geometry
updates for immediate remapping.

## Features

* Zero polling: WinEvent hooks (move, size, foreground, minimize, destroy, create, show).
* Target selection by process, window class, or title substring (CLI or GUI textbox).
* Launch with **no arguments** â†’ type selector â†’ press Start.
* Change selector: edit text, Stop â†’ Start to apply (live update roadmap item).
* Aspect ratio preservation (crops INPUT extents; always fills window pixelsâ€”no letterbox gaps).
* Automatic context reopen on foreground to mitigate driver resets.
* Tray icon (Green = active+present, Yellow = waiting/stopped; Red only on explicit error).
* Single small GUI: radios (selector type), editable textbox, Keep Aspect checkbox, Start/Stop.
* Clean shutdown via window close, tray Exit, or Ctrl+C.
* Verbose logging (`-v` debug, `-vv` trace) & quiet mode (`-q`).
* Tested fallback for finicky driver option bit combinations.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| OS        | Windows 10 / 11 (x64) |
| Rust      | Stable toolchain with MSVC (`rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) |
| Build Tools | Visual Studio Build Tools / Desktop C++ (for MSVC linker) |
| Tablet Driver | Official **Wacom** driver (WinTab API exposed) â€“ install before running |
| Hardware  | Wacom tablet (other WinTab devices may work, untested) |

### Install / Verify Toolchain

```powershell
# Install Rust (if missing)
winget install Rustlang.Rustup -e  # or download from https://rustup.rs

# Ensure MSVC host
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Confirm
rustc -V
cargo -V
```

### Wacom Driver

Download / update from: <https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers>

InkBound relies on the WinTab (wintab32.dll) interface the driver provides. If the driver is
missing or incompatible you will see early errors opening the context.

## Building

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/freddiehaddad/inkbound.git
cd inkbound
cargo build --release
```

Binary path: `target\release\inkbound.exe`

Optionally install to Cargo bin dir:

```powershell
cargo install --path .
inkbound.exe --help
```

## Usage Overview

You may specify a selector up front OR launch idle and choose in the GUI.

```text
inkbound --process photoshop.exe [options]
inkbound --win-class Chrome_WidgetWin_1 [options]
inkbound --title-contains Blender [options]
inkbound  # no selector => GUI idle
```

### Key Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--process <NAME>` | Match process executable (caseâ€‘insensitive, include `.exe`). |
| `--win-class <CLASS>` | Match exact topâ€‘level window class. |
| `--title-contains <SUBSTR>` | Match if window title contains substring (caseâ€‘sensitive). |
| `--preserve-aspect` | Crop tablet input to preserve window aspect (no distortion). |
| `-v / -vv` | Increase verbosity (debug / trace). |
| `-q` | Quiet (warnings + errors only). |

### Examples

```powershell
# Idle GUI, pick later
inkbound

# Krita with aspect preserved
inkbound --process krita.exe --preserve-aspect

# Chrome window by class (no aspect crop)
inkbound --win-class Chrome_WidgetWin_1

# Any window with "Blender" in title, trace logs
inkbound --title-contains Blender -vv

# Quiet mapping to SAI
inkbound --process sai.exe -q
```

### GUI Interaction

1. Choose selector type via radio buttons (Process / Class / Title).
2. Enter selector text (e.g. `photoshop.exe`).
3. (Optional) Check *Keep tablet aspect* to crop input extents.
4. Press *Start*.
5. Change target later: edit text â†’ Stop â†’ Start.

Tray menu: Rightâ€‘click â†’ Restore / Start|Stop / Exit. Doubleâ€‘click icon to restore.

Colors:

* Green â€“ run enabled & target window currently exists.
* Yellow â€“ waiting / stopped / target missing.
* Red â€“ explicit error path (failed context reopen / mapping failure).

## Tablet Driver Configuration

InkBound only adjusts WinTab **context geometry**; it does *not* rotate, flip, or calibrate hardware.

Recommended driver settings (Wacom Desktop Center / Settings):

1. Orientation: Set the physical orientation you use (landscape / portrait). InkBound assumes it.
2. Screen Area: "All Displays" or the unified desktop. (Let InkBound carve a subâ€‘region virtually.)
3. Tablet Area: Full tablet. (Cropping is done logically when aspect is preserved.)
4. Disable any driver feature that autoâ€‘remaps to the foreground app (to avoid conflicts).
5. If you rotate the tablet later, change it in the driver UI then restart InkBound.

## Logging & Diagnostics

Defaults to INFO. Override:

```powershell
# Debug
inkbound --process photoshop.exe -v

# Trace
inkbound --process photoshop.exe -vv

# Environment filter
$env:RUST_LOG = "inkbound=debug"; inkbound --process photoshop.exe

# Dump applied LOGCONTEXT state each update
$env:WINTAB_DUMP = "1"; inkbound --process photoshop.exe -v
```

Capture a trace log:

```powershell
inkbound --process photoshop.exe -vv 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath inkbound-trace.txt
```

## Architecture (Short Form)

1. Acquire default LOGCONTEXT via `WTInfoA`.
2. Open context with optimistic option flags (fallback list if driver rejects).
3. Install WinEvent hooks (create/show/destroy/location/foreground/minimize transitions).
4. Each relevant event recomputes geometry; aspect ON => build template & reopen; aspect OFF => apply in place.
5. Foreground switches trigger a defensive reopen (driver quirk mitigation).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Never turns green | Selector mismatch | Use `-vv`, verify exact process (incl. `.exe`) / class / title. |
| Area shrinks unpredictably | Competing driver foreground mapping | Disable driver autoâ€‘app mapping features. |
| Distorted / stretched mapping | Aspect not preserved | Enable `--preserve-aspect` / checkbox. |
| Cursor offset | Driver mapped to partial display | Set driver mapping to all displays; restart. |
| Stops after altâ€‘tabbing | Driver reset | Reopen heuristic already applied; update driver; file issue with logs. |
| Changed selector does nothing | Not reâ€‘started | Press Stop then Start to reapply hooks. |

## Limitations

* Windows only.
* Pen pressure / tilt untouched (pass through).
* No rotation logic; rely on driver orientation.
* Selector edits require a restart toggle (live update planned).
* Partial hook install tolerated (logged at trace level).

## Contributing

PRs and issues welcome. Please include:

* Tablet model & driver version
* Windows version (build number)
* Whether aspect mode was on
* Trace log (`-vv`) and, if geometry related, `WINTAB_DUMP=1`
