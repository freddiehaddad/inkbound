# InkBound

> Eventâ€‘driven WinTab tablet *window mapper* for Windows, written in Rust.

InkBound dynamically remaps your Wacom tablet's active area to a single application window
â€” selected by process name, window class, or title substring â€” and follows it instantly as it
moves, resizes, gains focus, minimizes, or is destroyed. No busy loops, no timers: just WinEvent
hooks and WinTab context updates.

## TL;DR (Quick Start)

```powershell
# Clone and build (MSVC toolchain required)
git clone https://github.com/freddiehaddad/inkbound.git
cd inkbound
cargo build --release

# Run with GUI only (choose target later)
./target/release/inkbound.exe

# Immediately map to Photoshop (process match; letterbox is default)
./target/release/inkbound.exe photoshop.exe

# Match a window title substring (stretch mapping)
./target/release/inkbound.exe Blender --by title --aspect stretch

# Debug logging
./target/release/inkbound.exe krita.exe --log debug
```

## Why Another Mapper?

Typical workflows either:

* Map the tablet to the whole desktop (wasted precision for a single app),
* Constantly visit the Wacom control panel, or
* Use polling tools that miss fast resizes or add latency.

InkBound fuses lightweight OS notifications (WinEvent) with direct WinTab context geometry
updates for immediate remapping.

## Features

* Zero polling: WinEvent hooks (move, size, foreground, minimize, destroy, create, show).
* Target selection by process, window class, or title substring (positional TARGET + --by, or GUI textbox + radios).
* Launch with **no arguments** â†’ type selector â†’ press Start.
* Change selector: edit text, Stop â†’ Start to apply (live update roadmap item).
* Two aspect modes:
  * letterbox (default): preserve target window aspect by cropping tablet input region.
  * stretch: fill target window (may distort if aspect differs).
* Automatic context reopen on foreground to mitigate driver resets.
* Tray icon (Green = active+present, Yellow = waiting/stopped; Red only on explicit error).
* Single small GUI: selector type radios, editable textbox, aspect radios (Letterbox / Stretch), Start/Stop.
* Clean shutdown via window close, tray Exit, or Ctrl+C.
* Unified logging flag: `--log error|warn|info|debug|trace` (default info).
* Tested fallback for finicky driver option bit combinations.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| OS        | Windows 10 / 11 (x64) |
| Rust      | Stable toolchain with MSVC (`rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) |
| Build Tools | Visual Studio Build Tools / Desktop C++ (for MSVC linker) |
| Tablet Driver | Official **Wacom** driver (WinTab API exposed) â€“ install before running |
| Hardware  | Wacom tablet (other WinTab devices may work, untested) |

### Install / Verify Toolchain

```powershell
# Install Rust (if missing)
winget install Rustlang.Rustup -e  # or download from https://rustup.rs

# Ensure MSVC host
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Confirm
rustc -V
cargo -V
```

### Wacom Driver

Download / update from: <https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers>

InkBound relies on the WinTab (wintab32.dll) interface the driver provides. If the driver is
missing or incompatible you will see early errors opening the context.

## Building

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/freddiehaddad/inkbound.git
cd inkbound
cargo build --release
```

Binary path: `target\release\inkbound.exe`

Optionally install to Cargo bin dir:

```powershell
cargo install --path .
inkbound.exe --help
```

## Usage Overview

General form (all flags optional):

```text
inkbound [TARGET] [--by process|class|title] [--aspect letterbox|stretch] [--log error|warn|info|debug|trace]
```

* Omit `TARGET` to launch GUI idle.
* Default `--by` is `process` (treat TARGET as an executable name, e.g. `krita.exe`).
* Default `--aspect` is `letterbox`.
* Default `--log` is `info`.

### Flags

| Arg / Flag | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `TARGET` | Optional selector string (process name, class name, or title substring). |
| `--by <kind>` | Interpret TARGET as `process`, `class`, or `title` (substring). |
| `--aspect <mode>` | `letterbox` (preserve / crop) or `stretch` (fill). |
| `--log <level>` | Verbosity: `error` `warn` `info` `debug` `trace`. |

### Examples

```powershell
# Idle GUI, pick later
inkbound

# Krita (process match, default letterbox)
inkbound krita.exe

# Chrome window class (stretch mapping)
inkbound Chrome_WidgetWin_1 --by class --aspect stretch

# Any window with "Blender" in title, trace logs
inkbound Blender --by title --log trace

# Photoshop with debug logs
inkbound photoshop.exe --log debug
```

### GUI Interaction

1. Choose selector type via radio buttons (Process / Class / Title).
2. Enter selector text (e.g. `photoshop.exe`).
3. Pick aspect mode via radios: Letterbox (preserve) or Stretch (fill).
4. Press *Start*.
5. Change target later: edit text â†’ Stop â†’ Start (live switching planned).

Tray menu: Rightâ€‘click â†’ Restore / Start|Stop / Exit. Doubleâ€‘click icon to restore.

Colors:

* Green â€“ run enabled & target window currently exists.
* Yellow â€“ waiting / stopped / target missing.
* Red â€“ explicit error path (failed context reopen / mapping failure).

## Tablet Driver Configuration

InkBound only adjusts WinTab **context geometry**; it does *not* rotate, flip, or calibrate hardware.

Recommended driver settings (Wacom Desktop Center / Settings):

1. Orientation: Set the physical orientation you use (landscape / portrait). InkBound assumes it.
2. Screen Area: "All Displays" or the unified desktop. (Let InkBound carve a subâ€‘region virtually.)
3. Tablet Area: Full tablet. (Cropping is done logically when aspect is preserved.)
4. Disable any driver feature that autoâ€‘remaps to the foreground app (to avoid conflicts).
5. If you rotate the tablet later, change it in the driver UI then restart InkBound.

## Logging & Diagnostics

Default level: info.

```powershell
# Debug detail
inkbound photoshop.exe --log debug

# Full trace (includes event + mapping detail)
inkbound photoshop.exe --log trace

# Override via environment (standard tracing subscriber semantics)
$env:RUST_LOG = "inkbound=debug"; inkbound photoshop.exe

# Capture a trace log to file (PowerShell)
inkbound photoshop.exe --log trace 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath inkbound-trace.txt
```

## Architecture (Short Form)

1. Acquire default LOGCONTEXT via `WTInfoA`.
2. Open context with optimistic option flags (fallback list if driver rejects).
3. Install WinEvent hooks (create/show/destroy/location/foreground/minimize transitions).
4. Each relevant event recomputes geometry; letterbox => crop & possibly reopen; stretch => direct apply.
5. Foreground switches trigger a defensive reopen (driver quirk mitigation).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Never turns green | Selector mismatch | Use `--log trace`, verify exact process (incl. `.exe`) / class / title. |
| Area shrinks unpredictably | Competing driver foreground mapping | Disable driver autoâ€‘app mapping features. |
| Distorted mapping | Using stretch when preservation desired | Switch aspect to letterbox (GUI radio / `--aspect letterbox`). |
| Cursor offset | Driver mapped to partial display | Set driver mapping to all displays; restart. |
| Stops after altâ€‘tabbing | Driver reset | Heuristic reopen already applied; update driver; file issue with trace log. |
| Changed selector does nothing | Not reâ€‘started | Press Stop then Start (live update planned). |

## Limitations

* Windows only.
* Pen pressure / tilt untouched (pass through).
* No rotation logic; rely on driver orientation.
* Selector edits require a restart toggle (live update planned).
* Partial hook install tolerated (logged at trace level).
